ASAB Web UI
===========

ASAB Web UI a library of webpack build scripts and React components built on top of [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
It is inspired by the architecture of [ASAB](https://github.com/teskalabs/asab) python project.
It is designed primarily for web-based user interfaces for ASAB microservices but it can be used in different architectures as well.


## Quick links

 - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
 - [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io)
 - [Atlas Icons](https://atlasicons.vectopus.com)


## Unified Features

 - Admin UI template
 - Header
 - Sidebar
 - Alerts
 - Network activity indicator
 - Axios based REST API configuration


## REST API design

TODO ...

```
[ASAB UI App] -- [ HTTP proxy (API_PATH) ] -- [ actual microservices ]
```

TODO: Example of `webpackDevServer` proxy config.

The default `API_PATH` is `api`, it means that it uses the HTTP location of the application itself.



## Start a project

Add this repo as a submodule to your project.

```
$ git init .
$ git submodule add https://github.com/TeskaLabs/asab-webui.git
```

Bootstrap your project with example files.

```
$ rsync -a --ignore-existing ./asab-webui/demo/* .
```

Install dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

## Run

`yarn start` runs the application in development mode.

```
$ yarn start
```

### Run with `DEV` configuration

```
$ yarn start -c conf/config.js
```

This option is suitable for developers, who want to provide specific configuration for the application (e.g. simulate list of `tenants`) and need to work on parts of the application without bundling it into static files for production via `yarn build`.

`DEV` configuration provides an option to simulate some part of the information usually obtained from the service, such as simulation of `userinfo` or any other configuration.

**Important note**: the configuration set in `devConfig` is **NOT** propagated to the production environment!

To find more about how to use `devConfig` and simulate `userinfo`, see `doc` folder in ASAB Web UI project:

```
/doc/devconfig.md
```

Example of `config.js`

Where

* `app` provide url, service and other common configuration, which is similar to build config

* `devConfig` provide configuration for devs, where e.g. `userinfo` can be simulated via `MOCK_USERINFO`. This is not a part of build config

* `webPackDevServer` where webpack settings for dev server is provided. This is not a part of build config

```
module.exports = {
	app: {
		BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3000',
		API_PATH: 'api',
		SERVICES: {
			openidconnect: 'openidconnect',
			asab_config: 'asab_config',
			seacat_auth_webui: 'http://localhost:3000/auth'
			}
		},
	devConfig: {
		MOCK_USERINFO: {
			"email": "test@test.te",
			"phone": "0123456789",
			"username": "Test",
			"resources": ["test:testy:read"],
			"roles": ["default/Gringo"],
			"sub": "tst:123456789",
			"tenants": ["default"]
		}
	},
	webPackDevServer: {
		port: 3000,
		proxy: {
			'/api/asab_config': {
				target: "http://localhost:8080",
				pathRewrite: { '^/api/asab_config': ''}
			},
		}
	}
}
```


## Build

`yarn build` bundles the application into static files for production.

```
$ yarn build
```

### Build for production to a specific public url

```
$ yarn build -u https://example.com/app
```

### Build for production with configuration

```
$ yarn build -c conf/config.js
```

Example of `config.js`

```
module.exports = {
	app: {
		BASE_URL: 'https://example.com',
		API_PATH: 'api',
		SERVICES: {
			openidconnect: 'openidconnect',
			asab_config: 'asab_config',
			seacat_auth_webui: 'https://example.com/auth'
			}
		}
}
```
